# go-kicker-slack
Creates a game for 4 person to join, and then sends notification to all of them when the game is set.
I have specifically amde this game for our kicker table, but you can change the concept to fit whatever you want.

The person who creates the game is automatically joined:

When everyone leaves / there is no one in the game, the game gets cancelled. (To prevent pollution on the channel):

When all slots get filled, text changes and it sends notification to everyone to inform that the game is ready:
